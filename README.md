# CSC212 Trie Project

## Trie: Overview
<p>
A Trie (a digital tree or prefix trees) is a special data structure that stores strings that can be visualized into a graph. Tries are a fundamental concept in computer science due to their ability to manipulate strings. Specifically, they allow for efficiency in storing and searching strings.
